# password-generator
A simple password generator which uses modal windows to solicit the user's parameters for the password, and generates a random password based upon the user selections.

## Description
This application generates a password of a user defined length (between 8-128 characters) and selected character types (uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special). The password is generated via JavaScript code.  The script is accessed via html with a button to initiate password generation and prompts and confirms to select password parameters.   After selection, the generated password is displayed in the browser window.

## Installation
